        <h2>Week 2 Entry</h2>
        <p><strong>1. How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
        I began by designing for small screens first, using simple layouts and stacking content vertically. Then I used media queries to rearrange elements on larger screens.</p>

        <p><strong>2. What was the most useful HTML/CSS concept this week?</strong><br>
        Flexbox was extremely helpful for creating responsive navigation and flexible page layouts.</p>

        <p><strong>3. What was most challenging?</strong><br>
        Understanding how media queries apply at different breakpoints was initially confusing, but practice made it easier.</p>
